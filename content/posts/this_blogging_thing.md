I used to keep a diary. Once. Well, for a couple of years, anyway. I was in my 30s and felt it was important to divulge my unimportant thoughts onto paper for posterity. I still have these diaries. There just a reminder of how foolish I was and how I often couldn't even keep to just writing a few lines. Maybe I was busy. I can't tell, because I can't remember everyday and there wasn't an entry for each day telling me that I couldn't complete that day's entry, because I was far too busy. In all probability, I was most likely just too tired and the diary became a burden, a source of guilt when I remembered I hadn't noted down a few day's worthless notes and then tortured myself by sitting down and desperately trying to remember anything from the previous few days. If anything, those diaries proved one thing - my short-term memory was rubbish. If only I'd kept to writing stuff down. It doesn't matter anyway as most of it was illegible. That's the other thing I learned. My handwriting has all the readability of a prescription from a stressed out GP.

In any case, I've learned my lesson. Instead of writing stuff down in manual diaries and carting them from house to house as perpetual reminders of lost years, I'll write stuff down on here. Typing is quicker than writing by hand anyway, and then random people from the internet can then tell me how pointless the effort was, so it won't be just myself. That'll be some weird kind of comfort, I guess. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I mostly plan to write on stuff like 3D rendering (Blender and Z-Brush mostly), coding, cricket, comedy, politics, and anything else that takes crosses my mind. That's the plan anyway. I probably won't stick to it. I mean I couldn't even bother keeping a diary, so what are the chances of keeping this site's content ticking over? I'll add some tracking anyway, so I can take some comfort that I'll have irritated some poor random bar steward who happens to come across this site. So if you happen to be that person - and yes, I mean You! - and you have reached this far, take comfort in the fact that there's a whole host of other websites you could also be wasting your precious time on. Isn't the internet wonderful?

I've worked in SEO for a decade now and you do hear these stories about these sites that started as blogs, built traffic, added some Ads to annoy the increasing number of visitors to that site and then these bloggers became so "influential", links from that website to your own would have so much "link equity", they then became a target for brands and would be sent free stuff to "review". One chap in the SEO industry often talks wistfully about those years and how about one particular blogger was sent a free car. Of course, this story could be complete BS - there's a fair amount of that in this industry, but if he or she did get a free car, I hope it was a Lada.

I don't particularly fancy myself becoming an influencer. I think most of them are on Tiktok. To date, I've only posted one short clip on Tiktok and I haven't been back to see how many likes or views it has had. I really don't care. Really, I don't! Tiktok seems to be mostly teenagers saying "Hey world, look at me do this dance thing in my bedroom/corridor!" You really don't want me to start doing that. I dance like a string puppet being handled by a coked-up puppet handler.

There's one guy on Tiktok whose sole MO seems to be that he just covers himself in paint. He's pretty creative in thinking up different ways to make himself technocoloured, but it's pretty tedious to watch. "Oh, look, I'm covered in paint. Watch me cover myself in more paint by exploding this paint-filled balloon on my head!" üôÑ

He gets 100s of thousands of likes. I can only assume that these are from people who clearly never slipped off a lightweight, clangy stepladder whilst trying emulsioning a living room ceiling. Gloss is a nightmare on your skin, so it must be water-based paint he's using and he doesn't go to bed like that, because if he does, he must wake up every morning to his bedsheets resembling a Jackson Pollock painting.
