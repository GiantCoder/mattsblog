I used to keep a diary. Once. Well, for a couple of years, anyway. I was in my 30s and felt it was important to divulge my unimportant thoughts onto paper for posterity. I still have these diaries. There just a reminder of how foolish I was and how I often couldn't even keep to just writing a few lines. Maybe I was busy. I can't tell, because I can't remember everyday and there wasn't an entry for each day telling me that I couldn't complete that day's entry, because I was far too busy. In all probability, I was most likely just too tired and the diary became a burden, a source of guilt when I remembered I hadn't noted down a few day's worthless notes and then tortured myself by sitting down and desperately trying to remember anything from the previous few days. If anything, those diaries proved one thing - my short-term memory was rubbish. If only I'd kept to writing stuff down. It doesn't matter anyway as most of it was illegible. That's the other thing I learned. My handwriting has all the readability of a prescription from a stressed out GP.

In any case, I've learned my lesson. Instead of writing stuff down in manual diaries and carting them from house to house as perpetual reminders of lost years, I'll write stuff down on here. Typing is quicker than writing by hand anyway, and then random people from the internet can then tell me how pointless the effort was, so it won't be just myself. That'll be some weird kind of comfort, I guess. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
