I'm tall (6'5"). People tend to notice that a lot, especially if they're shorter than me, which is most of the population of the UK, it seems. Old relatives no longer exclaim "Oooh! Haven't you grown?", though, which is a relief. I never understood why they did that anyway - weren't they expecting me to have grown? I'm pretty sure I was reasonably nourished by my parents, growing up. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Still, I'm glad I'm not getting taller. Any taller and the 36L trousers I normally buy wouldn't fit me. I'd have to do my clothes shopping in that special shop I saw in Manchester for tall people, which would be a real pain as I no longer live anywhere near Manchester and travel costs alone would increase the average price of a pair of green chinos by an unacceptable amount.

"High & Mighty" - I think that was the brand name of that shop. Bit of a cocky brand name, if you ask me. It suggests that we're a bit condescending, that we look down on shorter people, which, of course, we do, but not like that.

I suppose the best way I could describe myself is that I have an enquiring mind. I'd like to know everything there is to know, which is, of course, impossible. It's also possibly really dangerous, if you believe Indiana Jones 4 might be based on some sound understanding of how much knowledge one human brain can cope with. In that (terrible film - Harrison Ford is clearly getting too old to do his own stunts anymore) - Cate Blanchett's character asks the alien intelligence or whatever it was (ancient humans?) for complete knowledge and her head explodes. You would've thought they would have given her a warning or at least explain to her that they can give her 10% of everything there is to know and a couple of paracetamol. I might have settled for that, if I were her.
